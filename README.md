# Website

Another website written in NodeJs/Express but it's the home page to introduce myself and show what I've done before/what I do.

# 2024 UPDATE
TBH there's nothing interesting, I'll archive the repo and work on a React/Express Personal Website and put Server/Client in the same repo (like [this one](https://github.com/SounaVR/RatMessenger))
